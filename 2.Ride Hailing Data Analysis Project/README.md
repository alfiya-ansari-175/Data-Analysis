# Ride Hailing Data Analysis Project

This project presents an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a dataset containing trip information, likely from a ride-hailing service. The goal is to uncover temporal, spatial, and categorical patterns in the trip data and provide visual insights into travel behavior.

## 📌 Key Features

- 📆 Temporal analysis: Trips by hour, day, and month
- 🗺️ Spatial analysis: Top pickup and drop-off zones
- 📈 Distribution analysis: Trip durations and distances
- 🔁 Weekday vs Weekend patterns
- 🧪 Statistical testing: T-Test for comparing groups
- 🔥 Heatmaps for trend discovery
- 🔍 Outlier detection and replacement

## 📊 Visualizations Include:

- Line plots, bar charts, and histograms
- Box plots and violin plots for distribution analysis
- Heatmaps for dense pattern visualization
- Grouped bar plots for category analysis

## 📂 Structure

- `Ride Hailing Data Analysis.ipynb`: Main notebook containing the full analysis
- `README.md`: Project overview (this file)
- `requirements.txt`: List of required Python libraries
- `dataset`: MyUberDrives2016.csv

## 🧪 Tools Used

- Python 🐍
- Pandas 🐼
- Matplotlib 📊
- Seaborn 🧂
- Plotly 📍
- Scipy 🧪

## 🔍 Insights

- Certain hours and weekdays show significantly higher trip activity
- A few pickup-dropoff zones dominate the traffic
- Weekday trips tend to differ in duration from weekend ones
- Some categories have longer or shorter average trip times
- Outliers were present in trip distances and durations, and were treated appropriately
